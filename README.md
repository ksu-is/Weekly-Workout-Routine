# Weekly-Workout-Routine
For this project I will be creating a weekly work out routine for users to keep track of the exercises they are doing.

This program will be structure with direct user input. The user will be given the opportunity to tell the code what day it is and whether or not they worked out the previous day.
If the user inputs that they did not work out the previous day, a short message will pop up telling the user what they need to do in order to make up for not working out the day before.
If the user inputs that they did work out the day before then a message will pop up telling them what they need to do in order to stay on track.
